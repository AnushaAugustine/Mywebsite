# How to be a programmer !!

Debugging	is	the	cornerstone	of	being	a	programmer.	The	first	meaning	of	the	verb	"debug" is	to	remove	errors,	but	the	meaning	that	really	matters	is	to	see	into	the	execution	of	a program	by	examining	it.	A	programmer	that	cannot	debug	effectively	is	blind.


   The	common	ways	of	looking	into	the	‘innards’	of	an	executing	program	can	be	categorized as:
   <li>Using	a	debugging	tool,</li>
   <li>Printlining	-	Making	a	temporary	modification	to	the	program,	typically	adding	lines	that print	information
   out</li>
   <li>Logging	-	Creating	a	permanent	window	into	the	programs	execution	in	the	form	of	a log.</li>

### How	to	Debug	Using	a	Log

logs	offer	three	basic	advantages:

<li>Logs	can	provide	useful	information	about	bugs	that	are	hard	to	reproduce	(such	as those	that	occur	in	the	production
    environment	but	that	cannot	be	reproduced	in	the	test environment).</li>
<li>Logs	can	provide	statistics	and	data	relevant	to	performance,	such	as	the	time	passing between	statements.</li>
<li>When	configurable,	logs	allow	general	information	to	be	captured	in	order	to	debug unanticipated	specific	problems	without
    having	to	modify	and/or	redeploy	the	code	just to	deal	with	those	specific	problems.</li>

### How to	Deal	with	I/O	Expense

There	are	two	very	fundamental	techniques	to	improving	I/O:	caching	and	representation.
<p>- Caching	is	avoiding	I/O by	storing	a copy	of	that	value	locally	so	no	I/O	is	performed	to	get	the	value.</p>
<p>- Representation	is	the	approach	of	making	I/O	cheaper	by	representing	data	more	efficiently. This	is	often	in	tension
with
<p>- other	demands,	like	human	readability	and	portability. </p>

### How	to	Conduct	Experiments

The	kinds	of	experiments	you	will	have	to	perform	include:

<li>Testing	systems	with	small	examples	to	verify	that	they	conform	to	the	documentation	or to	understand	their	response	when
    there	is	-no	documentation, </li>
<li>Testing	small	code	changes	to	see	if	they	actually	fix	a	bug,</li>
<li>Measuring	the	performance	of	a	system	under	two	different	conditions	due	to	imperfect knowledge	of	their	performance
    characteristics,</li> 
<li>Checking	the	integrity	of	data,	and </li>
<li>Collecting	statistics	that	may	hint	at	the	solution	to	difficult	or	hard-to-repeat	bugs.</li>

### How	to	Utilize	People	as	Information Sources

Respect	every	person's	time	and	balance	it	against	your	own.	Asking	someone	a	question accomplishes	far	more	than	just
receiving	the	answer.	The	person	learns	about	you,	both	by enjoying	your	presence	and	hearing	the	particular
question.	You	learn about	the	person	in the	same	way,	and	you	may	learn	the	answer	you	seek.	This	is	usually
far	more	important than	your	question.

### Take	Breaks	when	Stumped

When	stumped,	take	a	breakt.	A	night's	sleep	sometimes	does	the same	thing	on	a	larger	scale.

### How	to	Deal	with	Difficult	People

One	of	the	challenges	that	every	programmer	but	especially	leaders	face	is	keeping	the difficult	person	fully	engaged
